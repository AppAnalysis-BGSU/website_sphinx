In the recent past, I pursued research in the following areas: Android app analysis (details of our Amandroid tool are available here), Pub/Sub with P2PSIP, optimal scheduling of the message ferry in DTNs, game models for DoS/DDoS attacks, stochastic games for cyber security, non-monotonic ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, and attack-resilient hierarchical data aggregation protocols for sensor networks.
